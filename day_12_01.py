# I just judged and counted by hand/eye to find the right solution.
# Could not solve this by writing a program.
# Read later on the forum that you need a "BFS" algorithm, that is a special case of Dijkstra's algorithm.
# I haven't heard about these before, so might return later to learn more and try the solution.
